I am a web developer and I live in Buenos Aires. I have been working as a freelance in web development for 6 years. In 2014 I founded LaCueva.tv which is a web development agency that combines design, UX and technology. In 2018 I started working at Portinos as a developer where I became the team leader after two years of work. Now I have new challenges, I like to be a leader and I am working to make the development area bigger.
